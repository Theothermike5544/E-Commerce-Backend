# E-Commerce-Backend

## Description

 The retailer in this application know as E-Commerce, is a player in the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2017. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.

 In this application I built the back end for an e-commerce site and configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

```
  AS A manager at an internet retail company
  I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
  SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```
